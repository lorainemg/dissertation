	abstract="As data science becomes increasingly mainstream, there will be an ever-growing demand for data science tools that are more accessible, flexible, and scalable. In response to this demand, automated machine learning (AutoML) researchers have begun building systems that automate the process of designing and optimizing machine learning pipelines. In this chapter we present TPOT v0.3, an open source genetic programming-based AutoML system that optimizes a series of feature preprocessors and machine learning models with the goal of maximizing classification accuracy on a supervised classification task. We benchmark TPOT on a series of 150 supervised classification tasks and find that it significantly outperforms a basic machine learning analysis in 21 of them, while experiencing minimal degradation in accuracy on 4 of the benchmarks---all without any domain knowledge nor human input. As such, genetic programming-based AutoML systems show considerable promise in the AutoML domain.",

	abstract = {In this work, an automatic machine learning (AutoML) modeling architecture called
	Autostacker is introduced. Autostacker combines an innovative hierarchical stacking
	architecture and an evolutionary algorithm (EA) to perform efficient parameter search
	without the need for prior domain knowledge about the data or feature preprocessing.
	Using EA, Autostacker quickly evolves candidate pipelines with high predictive accuracy.
	These pipelines can be used in their given form, or serve as a starting point for
	further augmentation and refinement by human experts. Autostacker finds innovative
	machine learning model combinations and structures, rather than selecting a single
	model and optimizing its hyperparameters. When its performance on fifteen datasets
	is compared with that of other AutoML systems, Autostacker produces superior or competitive
	results in terms of both test accuracy and time cost.},
